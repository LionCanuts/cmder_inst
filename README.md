# Cmder Installer

Cmder Installer is an install executable that will fetch the latest version of Cmder online, un-pack it, and install it, using the Nullsoft Installer. It has several options including location to install to, windows explorer integration, and shorcuts.

## About Cmder
[Cmder](http://Cmder.net) is a **software package** created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) with *major* config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, amazing [clink](https://github.com/mridgers/clink) (further enhanced by [clink-completions](https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions)) and a custom prompt layout.
